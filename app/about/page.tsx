              I‚Äôm a CSE graduate from Punjabi University and have been bringing
              my ideas to life for the past four years. From building robots and
              IoT-powered taxi-top billboards to creating apps and developing AI
              voice agents, my journey has been a wild mix of innovation and
              adventure. On the frontend, my life looks awesome, but on the
              backend, it's a chaotic mess just like any great tech project. But
              hey, I love the way I live!
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-muted-foreground">
              I played a key role in scaling Oyela‚Äôs platform from search to
              over 500k MAU, built multiple products from scratch, and led tech
              teams to success. I‚Äôve also been recognized as the Youngest Child
              Scientist and won National Science Fair awards so yeah, I‚Äôve been
              geeking out since childhood.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-muted-foreground">
              Beyond tech, I‚Äôm always chasing thrill and adventure. I‚Äôve done
              the world‚Äôs highest paragliding in Bir Billing at 2,400 meters
              above sea level and taken a leap of faith with the world‚Äôs
              second-highest bungee jump in Nepal at 228 meters.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-muted-foreground">
              By day, I build AI-powered solutions, and by night, I‚Äôm a tech
              geek, foodie at heart, and traveler by nature. My passion spans
              across startups, AI, automation, and solving real world problems,
              and I‚Äôm always looking for the next big thing to build.<br></br>{" "}
              And no matter where I go, my love for dogs follows me because some
              things in life are just non-negotiable. üê∂üíô
