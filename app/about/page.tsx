                I‚Äôm a CSE graduate from Punjabi University (2021) and have been
                bringing my ideas to life for the past four years. From building
                robots and IoT-powered taxi-top billboards to creating apps and
                developing AI voice agents, my journey has been a wild mix of
                innovation and adventure. On the frontend, my life looks
                awesome, but on the backend, it's a chaotic mess just like any
                great tech project. But hey, I love the way I live!
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg text-muted-foreground">
                I played a key role in scaling{" "}
                <a href="https://oyela.in/">Oyela‚Äôs</a> platform from scratch to
                over 500k MAU, built multiple products from scratch, and led
                tech teams of 10+ members. I‚Äôve also been recognized as the
                Youngest Child Scientist and won National Science Fair awards so
                yeah, I‚Äôve been geeking out since childhood.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg text-muted-foreground">
                Beyond tech, I‚Äôm always chasing thrill and adventure. I‚Äôve done
                the world‚Äôs highest paragliding in Bir Billing at 2,400 meters
                above sea level and taken a leap of faith with the world‚Äôs
                second-highest bungee jump in Nepal at 228 meters.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg text-muted-foreground">
                By day, I ideate, and by night, I‚Äôm a tech geek, foodie at
                heart, and traveller by nature. My passion spans across
                startups, AI, automation, and solving real world problems, and
                I‚Äôm always looking for the next big thing to build.<br></br> And
                no matter where I go, my love for dogs follows me because some
                things in life are just non-negotiable. üê∂üíô
